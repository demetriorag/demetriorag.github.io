I"Ï<p>My name is Demetrio Ragusa and I am an aspiring network
engineer out of British Columbia, Canada.</p>

<p>I am 44 year-old, married, from Greece. I used to be a Chef and owner of
little Italian restaurant serving fresh pasta in Athens.</p>

<p>Since moving to Canada I decided to change careers and follow my passion
in Tech.</p>

<p>I recently got my CCNA certification and I am working towards my CCNP
(Encor) and DEVNET certifications.</p>

<p>My personal interests are gaming, cooking and motorcycles!</p>

<p>The main purpose of this blog is to share my ideas / processes /
thoughts as I progress through my studies and invite discussion around
them.</p>
