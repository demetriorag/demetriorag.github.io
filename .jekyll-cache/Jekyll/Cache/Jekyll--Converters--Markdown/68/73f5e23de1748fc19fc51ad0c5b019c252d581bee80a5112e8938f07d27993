<h4 id="books">Books:</h4>
<p>I will be using the CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core official cert guide from Cisco Press as my main reading material.</p>

<h4 id="video-training">Video Training:</h4>
<p>CBT Nuggets and their CCNP Encor training video series as a main source of video training.</p>

<h4 id="labs">Labs:</h4>
<p>Because the  physical equipment I currently own are not adequate for labbing for the CCNP, I will be using EVE-NG Pro and Cisco’s VIRL for my images. A great resource on how to set everything up is Data Knox’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7SD3zfCjkiDWvSFthIQSg">YouTube channel</a>, as he explains the process in detail. Thank you Knox!</p>

<h4 id="anki">Anki:</h4>
<p>Flashcards are a life saver! Anki is great program as it is a free and open-source flashcard program using spaced repetition. I will be making flashcards as I move through my studies and review them every couple of days. I will also be using the ‘DIKTA’ questions, that can be found at the beginning of every chapter, as a review.</p>

<h4 id="exam-prep">Exam prep:</h4>
<p>Boson’s Ex-Sim Max for Cisco 350-401 ENCOR is one of the best exam simulations out there. As you move through the questions, they provide you with comprehensive explanations and detailed references.</p>

<p>So, how do we go about on tackling this certification? After all it is a beast of an exam! I start by watching the video series, as this gives a high level overview on every topic that I am about to dig into. After watching the video series, I read the OCG to further my understanding on the information learned in the videos. If I don’t have a good grasp on a particular topic, I go back to the videos to better my understanding.
At this point I begin to create Anki flash cards on the information I need to memorize. As I progress and familiarize myself with the topic, I review their content and tailor them to fit my current progress.
Then comes the labbing part, the fun part! The part where all the information we’ve learned starts to make sense and comes together.</p>

<p>After reviewing the exam topics, if I feel that I have a solid understanding of them, I begin the exam prep using Boson’s Ex-Sim Max. Only after scoring a consistent 90-95% on the exam prep, will I then take the exam. The chances of failing are high, but the silver lining here is that it gives you an idea on what kind of questions are asked. It also provides insight on your level of knowledge and highlights the points that need to be worked on further!</p>

<p>So join me on this journey and let’s begin!</p>
