My name is Demetrio Ragusa and I am an aspiring network engineer out of
British Columbia, Canada.

After owning and operating my own business in Greece for more than 10
years, I felt it was time to tap into my passion for Tech. Upon moving
to Canada with my wife in 2016, I decided to use this opportunity to
turn my passion into a career and embarked on this journey.

I recently obtained my CCNA Certification and I am currently working
towards my CCNP (Encor) and DEVNET certifications\... I could not be
more excited and passionate about the path I have chosen!

In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, cooking and tinkering with
electronics. I am also an avid motorcycle enthusiast who has a deep love
for BMW motorcycles.

I started this blog in order to share my thoughts, ideas, and processes
as I progress through my studies, and I invite others to join me on this
journey. Please feel free to email me with your comments, questions or
to start a conversation; I look forward to connecting with you. Welcome
to my blog!
